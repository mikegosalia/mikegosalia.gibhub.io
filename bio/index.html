				<p>Mike Gosalia was born in Kansas City, Kansas in 1980 to parents Linda B. and Dr. Anil V. Gosalia, MD. His mother comes from a small town in New Brunswick, Canada and his father from Mumbai, India. The two married in Canada in December of 1975 then moved to the United States soon afterward. Mike had a quiet childhood growing up in Overland Park, Kansas. He attended The Barstow School and received excellent grades in math and science. </p><br>
				<p>In 1999 Mike attended The University of Chicago to study English and Literature. He particularly enjoyed Shakespeare&rsquo;s tragedies, romances, and comedies. He spent one year rowing on the intramural crew team. He graduated with a Bachelor of Arts in English Language and Literature.</p><br>
				<p>Since his father&rsquo;s heritage began in Mumbai, Mike often traveled with his family to India to know family and learn Indian culture. He spent seven months in France to learn French. But it wasn&rsquo;t enough. He was invited to Los Angeles to appear as an extra in a TV show, but it wasn&rsquo;t enough. He was accepted at the University of Missouri-Columbia to study law, but it wasn&rsquo;t enough. </p><br>
				<p>In 2008 he moved to Mumbai, India, where he worked for a bank. This enabled him to use the city of Mumbai in his first novel. But it wasn&rsquo;t enough. He returned to the United States in 2010 to live in Seattle. He attempted to do a master&rsquo;s in chemistry at the University of Washington, but it wasn&rsquo;t enough. </p><br>
				<p>After years of thinking about characters and stories, of all he had seen and experienced, Mike felt compelled to pursue writing seriously. This was enough. </p><br>
				<p>He was able to complete his first novel, The Drug from Mumbai, which was picked up immediately and published by The Zharmae Publishing Press. This was enough. </p><br>
				<p>Mike has completed a second novel and is currently working on a third. Because of his prior travels and studies, which he sees as a valuable prelude, he has found his calling and strengths. Every day is enough.</p><br>
				<p>Mike currently lives in Seattle. Between working a day job in customer service and spending time with friends and family, you may find him sitting in one of Seattle&rsquo;s many coffee shops. If you see him, please say hello. This will be enough!</p>
