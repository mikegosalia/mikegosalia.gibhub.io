				<h2>"When I opened "The Drug from Mumbai" and realized the author was writing as Timothy, a senior in college, I was fascinated to read how adroitly he was tricked and seamlessly captivated into becoming a drug courier. I was smitten by Timothy's audacity, naivete, and willingness to seek adventure. I had to follow him to Paris and Mumbai to make sure he would succeed and stay alive. It took me two days to read this book. I loved this character; now I'm waiting impatiently for a sequel. Hurry up, Mike!"</h2>

				<h2><b>Prologue, pg 3.</b></h2><br>
				<p>&emsp;The starting gun had been fired. I could see all the guys chasing me, and so I was off. Down the hall I went. I barreled into a set of double doors. They flew open. I raced outside onto the school grounds, running as hard as I could. Forget my backpack. I took it off long before I ever hit the grass. <br>
				&emsp;Oh, God, I thought, Why&rsquo;d I ever get myself into this mess? Jealousy? Selfishness? What was it? I&rsquo;d been in love with Deborah for so long now that when I saw Cody cheating on her at a party with her best friend, I couldn&rsquo;t help but say something. And now she knows I&rsquo;m in love with her!<br>
				&emsp;Just then I jumped a bench that was sitting there on the grass next to the soccer field and continued on my way, racing as hard as I could down the track. Cody and his henchmen were nigh on my heels. I had absolutely no time to turn around and check where they were. Hell, I knew they were there. Finally I reached the track. I zipped through the gated entrance and ran onto one of the lanes. Down it I sped. The others followed. </p>

				<h2><b>Chapter 7, pg 94.</b></h2><br>
				<p>&emsp;&ldquo;Well, listen,&rdquo; she continued, &ldquo;I overheard you talking on the phone the other day, when you were at my party, and I know that you have something going on tomorrow.&rdquo;<br>
				&emsp;&ldquo;Wait, what?&rdquo;<br>
				&emsp;&ldquo;Yeah, a delivery.&rdquo;<br>
				&emsp;I looked back at Alexis, astonished.<br>
				&emsp;&ldquo;So what if I do?&rdquo;<br>
				&emsp;&ldquo;Well, I want you to take me along. If you say no I&rsquo;ll tell your friend here. You wouldn&rsquo;t want that, now would you?&rdquo;<br>
				&emsp;I paused for a moment. I surely wouldn&rsquo;t want that, but I also remembered what Susan told me, that I shouldn&rsquo;t tell anyone about this.<br>
				&emsp;&ldquo;Now, you listen here,&rdquo; I said, reaching across the table to catch hold of Alexis&rsquo;s arm. &ldquo;This isn&rsquo;t a joke. You can&rsquo;t just do this to me.&rdquo; <br>
				&emsp;She just laughed. <br>
				&emsp;&ldquo;Yes, I can,&rdquo; she said.</p>

				<h2><b>Chapter 12, pg 180.</b></h2><br>
				<p>&emsp;&ldquo;It took us some time to find you,&rdquo; he said to the Israeli, &ldquo;But never mind that, Monsieur Israel. The point is that we are here now, together.&rdquo;<br>
				&emsp;&ldquo;To what do I owe this honor?&rdquo; asked the Israeli.<br>
				&emsp;&ldquo;Oh, I think we both know the answer to that question,&rdquo; said Mr. Larrieux, laughing. &ldquo;Now, tell me, where is the package?&rdquo;<br>
				&emsp;&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what you mean,&rdquo; said the Israeli.<br>
				&emsp;&ldquo;Damn it!&rdquo; screamed Mr. Larrieux.<br>
				The Israeli looked back at Peter, afraid.<br>
				&emsp;&ldquo;Listen, Peter,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;You missed your chance. It&rsquo;s long gone by now.&rdquo;<br>
				&emsp;&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; he said, incredulously, &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll see about that.&rdquo;<br>
				He looked over at one of his men and said, &ldquo;Quick, check the place.&rdquo;<br>
				&emsp;One of the men started checking behind the pub and in the back room while the other kept guard. He opened the door to the basement and went down. It infuriated Mr. Larrieux to find that there was nothing there. It was then that he recognized me.</p>
